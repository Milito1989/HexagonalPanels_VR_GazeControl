In this project we will focus on Multi perspective Hypermedia Environments (MHEs) and the main motivation is
to facilitate knowledge work in educational and scientific contexts where the basic observations are pointing
out that MHEs equipped with elaborated 2D interfaces can support multi perspective reasoning skills (MPRSs).

Used data: Animal Ontology information

For rendering the images on panels: A layout algorithm has been used in order to render animal images in panels so 
that they would cover the entire area of a panel

The horizontal Panel Includes: 
Sorted animals according to their lifespans all automatically and at run-time

Each panel will get scaled by gazing at the question mark in the middle for two seconds.
by gazing at the cross icon for two second the panel/image will get rescaled.


Highlighting
Animals in the same catagory (mamals, aquatic, ...) will get highlighted upon looking; 
The developed schema also have the cross-panel highlighting ability.


Text Description
After gazing at the info button which is placed to the lower right of each image 
the correspondig habitat and behavior description of the animal will be shown
